- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriele Cotigliani
- 👀 I’m interested in Technology, Games, Programming Languages, Networking;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, Kotlin, Scripting and Network architecture and equipment configuration;
-  :sparkler: I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects, but also I would like to learn front end, as I enjoy UI, UX desing, where I found myself very creative (surprisingly)
I will make my page look better as soon as I get my Uni modules out of the way;
